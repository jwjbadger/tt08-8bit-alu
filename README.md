# Tiny Tapeout Wokwi 8-Bit ALU 

A simple 8-bit ALU created using Wokwi. It was a joy to create and far simpler than anything else. While originally intended to become a full-fledged CPU, after creating a 16-byte RAM module and noting the intense lag (~3 seconds to reroute a wire), I ended up settling on leaving it how it is now.

Please check the documentation for more information! You can find information on the pinout and more details on the underlying methods used there.
